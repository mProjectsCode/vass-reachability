// how do we represent the counter updates as labels?
// we can represent the counter updates as a tuple of two integers, the first integer is the counter to update, the second integer is the value to update the counter by
// or maybe we can stick with vectors?
// no, because that would inflate our alphabet
// we can represent them as integers from starting from 1 to represent incrementing the counter i and -i to represent decrementing the counter i

///
/// The alphabet of the Dyck VASS are symbols that increment and decrement a specific counter.
///
/// An accepting run in the Dyck VASS is a run that starts and ends with all counters at 0 and never goes below 0 in any counter.
///
/// Here increasing a counter `i âˆˆ [1; size]` is done by the `i32` value `i` and decreasing a counter `i` is done by `-i`.
/// So `5_i32` increments counter 5 and `-5_i32` decrements counter 5.
