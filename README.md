# VASS Reachability Tool

A work in progress tool for solving VASS reachability based on recent results on regular separability for VASS reachability languages.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (and Cargo) 1.79.0 and above

## Usage

Currently the project only includes tests which can be run with:

```sh
cargo test
```

Or with `cargo test -- --nocapture` to preserve debug output.
